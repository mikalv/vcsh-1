Notes on vcsh, taken from javac development

* promises and streams would be useful for lex.

* vcsh really suffers from the lack of a pretty printer. Some of the structure
  dumps from syn are 7K characters long on one line of text!

  * Dotty visualization might be a reasonble interim solution.

* The quality of debugging back traces leaves something to be desired, since
  we do not show much detail about the currently evaluating form. Tail
  call elimination implies we don't show many intermediate forms either, so
  it can be difficult to tell where a failure is occurring.
