* Requirements
** Global Repository of Files
*** Persistant, fire-safe backup
**** 'Cold-Start' Recoverability... should be possible to recover with only Windows+Git
*** Multiple instances distributed across PC's
*** Out of band Metadata stored in readable format within repository
*** Support non-picture content (arbitrary files, movies, music, etc.)
*** Direct URL access to pictures
*** Support multiple distributed local repositories
*** Support partial repository snapshots

** Automatic Picture Import
*** One-step import (insert card, autodetected, pops up import dialog, starts/completes import)
*** Import runs on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux
*** Data duplication avoided, even for multiply imported pictures/videos
*** Data automatically backed up to fire-safe, after import

** Display
*** Simple GUI tagging/display of pictures
*** Drag/Drop (tags onto pictures, pictures onto tags)
*** Pervasive Search

* General Architecture
** Storage Layer
*** git back end storage for local repositories
*** Fire-safe backup in Amazon S3
**** jgit push/pull between S3 and local git
** Picture Importer
*** Listens for new pictures (using OS-specific mechanism).
*** Computes SHA-1 hash for all picture, and moves into well-known git repository
*** Adds/Commits Pictures
** Data Flow
*** Watches for git repo changes, and pushes upstream
** vcsh for administration/scripting
