vCalc is an advanced scientific calculator based on the Reverse Polish notation used on well-known handheld calculators. Its keyboard driven interface has been thoughtfully designed to be both easy to learn and fast to use. vCalc supports a complete set of scientific operations, binary math in hexadecimal and octal, and has a sophisticated statistics engine that mean-centers data before computation for high numerical accuracy with difficult datasets. vCalc also supports 100 memory registers, has a 10-level "undo" feature, and has the ability to save and load data to disk.
